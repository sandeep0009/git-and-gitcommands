// git is a version control tool which is used for tracking and managing changes to the software code.there are three types of version control:

Local version control system => in this a local database is located in your computer and every file change is stored in patch.
Centralised verisoin control system =>in this there is single server that contains all the file verisons.and this helps to have multiple clients to acces the file simultaneously
Distributed version control system =>in this everyone who are collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project i.e owns their own local database with their own complete history.


// Github is basically a hosting service designed for git repository and it is totally based on cloud and you share it and givr access to others so that they can make changes in it


// some git commands and their functionality :

git status => will tell you about state of working directory and staging area

touch filename.txt => will create a new file only if doesn't already exist

git commit -m "message" => it performs a commit and -m "message" add  message.

git log => it will tell repository history and also will tell you who commited in the file and when it was committed

git add . => will add the files and you have to do it every time when you commit the changes in the file

git config --global user.email "name of email" => this will change the current email author and --globally will do it for all the repository

git config --global user.name "name of user" => will change the username globally


//push: basically we push our code to github where we can host our code.

*Note:= Before pushing anything on the github we need a ssh key for that otherwise it wont able to push the file on the github.


Push and pull commands :

git push -u origin main => this will push your code or file on th github

for pull request we will go on any repository on github and will go in documention and it will describe all the commands for pull request
